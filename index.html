        <h2>Why Go Veggie?</h2>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Reduce risk of the No. 1 killer – Heart Disease</h3>
            <p>Vegetarian diets tend to be naturally lower in saturated fat and cholesterol
             and have a higher intake of plant nutrients than most meat-based diets.
             Vegetarians have been shown to have a 24% lower risk of dying of heart disease
             than non-vegetarians</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Cancer prevention</h3>
            <p>Regularly consuming a diet that contains fruits and vegetables
             is strongly associated with a reduced risk of some cancers.
             There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a lower overall 
             rate of cancer compared to the general population. 
             “Red meat and processed meat consumption is consistently associated 
             with an increase in the risk of colorectal cancer.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Lose excess weight and keep it off.</h3>
            <p>On average, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index 
                (a measure of body fat) than meat eaters.The Oxford Vegetarian Study 
                found that BMI levels are lower in vegetarians of all age groups and 
                for both men and women. Vegetarians may have lower BMI due to consumption 
                of a diet that is high in fiber-rich and low-energy foods such as fruits and vegetables </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Live longer, slow the aging process.</h3>
            <p>A 12-year Oxford study published in the British Medical Journal found 
                that vegetarians outlive meat eaters by six years.7  
                Plant-based diets are generally rich in fiber, phytonutrients, antioxidants, 
                vitamins and minerals, which in turn strengthens the immune system and 
                slows down the aging process. Additionally, a vegetarian diet can prevent and 
                reverse certain chronic diseases</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Reduce Global Warming.</h3>
            <p>The United Nations said in its 2006 report that livestock generate more greenhouse gases
                 than all the cars and trucks in the world combined.8  Most of it comes from carbon-dioxide
                 and nitrous oxide gases generated by manure. Therefore, the single most important step 
                 an individual can take to reduce global warming is to adopt a vegetarian diet.</p>
